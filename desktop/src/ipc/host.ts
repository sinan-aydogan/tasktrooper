/**
 * The contract between this shell and the web app it serves.
 *
 * The desktop app is the web app in a window, plus a supervisor. Every screen
 * the user sees is the web app's; the only thing this shell adds is the set of
 * things a browser tab cannot do — run the backend, open a native folder
 * picker, and say what this Mac can and cannot run. Those arrive as
 * `window.__tasktrooperDesktop`, installed by `preload/cloud.ts` and answered
 * by the main process.
 *
 * This file is one half of a contract whose other half is
 * `ui/src/lib/desktop-bridge.ts`. The two are separate declarations because the
 * SPA builds in a browser with no knowledge of this package; they are kept
 * structurally identical instead — a change here that is not made there shows
 * up as a page that calls a method the shell does not have.
 *
 * There is no sign-in anywhere in this product, so nothing on this bridge is a
 * credential for a person. `apiToken` is the bearer for a loopback server this
 * same process started; it is the one value that travels shell → page, and it
 * grants access to nothing that is not already on this machine.
