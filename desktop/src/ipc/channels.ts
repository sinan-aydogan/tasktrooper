/**
 * Every IPC channel this app has, in one list.
 *
 * The list is exhaustive on purpose. `contextIsolation` and a sandboxed
 * renderer are only worth having if the surface they gate is small enough to
 * read, and a preload that forwards arbitrary channel names re-opens exactly
 * the hole those two settings close. So: named channels, typed payloads,
 * validated in the main process before anything acts on them.
 *
 * Two namespaces:
 *
 *   SHELL_* — the native chrome: a title bar with a status pill, a reload
 *             button, the update affordance and the screen that says so when
 *             the backend did not come up. It asks for almost nothing.
 *   CLOUD_* — the WebContentsView running the bundled SPA. Our own code, served
 *             from `app://tasktrooper`, but it is still the widest half of the
 *             surface — Connect, the workspace picker, the preflight and
 *             diagnostics all live there — so every handler on it verifies the
 *             sender on every call, not once at load. See main/ipc.ts.
